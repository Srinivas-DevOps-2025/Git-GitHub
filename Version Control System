**Version Control System Introduction**

A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool, that helps developers/users to manage the source code efficiently over a time.
It facilitates collabaration, track the versions, and records modications.

**Importance**
1. Collabaration: Multiple developers can work on same project simultaneously.
2. History Tracking: VCS maintains a detailed history of code changes, including who made each change and when. This historical record aids in understanding the evolution of the project and is invaluable for debugging and auditing purposes
3. Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches, enabling them to work on new features or fixes independently. Once completed, these branches can be merged back into the main codebase, streamlining development workflows.
